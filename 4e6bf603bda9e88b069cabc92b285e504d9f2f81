If it doesn\u0027t preview correctly, I will follow up to fix it.  I don\u0027t know of any way to simulate this ahead of time, but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s critical.\n\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, seems like we might as well drop the blank line between `about` and `title` (unless it\u0027s needed for some weird reason of course).\n\nI think it\u0027s needed to differentiate between the wrapped string and the key.  I\u0027m hesitant to change it until we\u0027ve seen it render.  If it\u0027s ok, I\u0027d like to leave it as-is.  It\u0027s just whitespace ðŸ˜Š",
